      <h1>Hi, I'm Khuong!</h1>
      <p>
          I am a fullstack developer with a background in biochemistry and
          optics. I consider myself to be a life-long learner who enjoys the
          thrill of pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and facing new
          challenging problems head-on. This love for innovation was what
          eventually lead me to coding; to enroll to Fullstack Academy, a
          fully immersive bootcamp; and finally to become a Teaching Fellow at
          that very bootcamp, where I could continue foster that same love for
          learning to a class of 30 aspiring developers.
      </p>
      <p>
      In my free time, you can find me taking long walks along Chicago's
          beautiful lakeshore drive, struggling at Linchess chess puzzles and
          jamming the few guitar chords which I actual do know!
